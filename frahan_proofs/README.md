# Frahan StonePack — formal derivations (Lean 4 + Mathlib)

Machine-checked derivations for the algorithms shipped in this
repository. The mathematical spec is
[`spec/frahan_algorithm_derivations.tex`](spec/frahan_algorithm_derivations.tex)
(~33 named results across 27 algorithm families, from kriging and slab
trimming to nesting, masonry equilibrium and registration); the build
order is [`spec/PLAN_lean_formalization.md`](spec/PLAN_lean_formalization.md).

## Honesty contract

- Every Lean result carries a docstring citing its `.tex` label, so the
  informal proof and the mechanized one stay in sync.
- **No `sorry` anywhere.** A result is either proved, or stated as
  `proof_wanted` in `FrahanProofs/Roadmap.lean`, or listed there as a
  TODO awaiting supporting definitions. Tier-3 analysis results
  (Varadhan, Stolt, EM convergence, KKT) will import their classical
  ingredient as a *named axiom with a literature citation* when stated —
  the development is explicit about what is proved versus cited.

## Status

Proved (no `sorry`), dimension-generic over any real inner-product
space where applicable:

| tex label | result | file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lem:sh` | a half-plane clip is exactly intersection: subset + measure-monotone ("every clip only removes material") | `Common.lean` |
| `thm:trim` | the greedy-trim chain equals `P ∩ ⋂ Hₜ`, stays inside `P`, never gains measure, and is convex for convex input | `Common.lean` |
| `lem:clip3d` | subsumed — the formalization is dimension-generic | `Common.lean` |
| `thm:kahn` | source-existence: a finite acyclic precedence order always offers a next installable part (Kahn's loop never sticks) | `Common.lean` |
| `thm:kahn` | order-existence: every strict precedence embeds in a total install order with all edges strict (via Szpilrajn / `extend_partialOrder`) | `Scheduling.lean` |
| `prop:power` | the power cell is convex — the quadratic terms cancel, each constraint is a half-space | `Power.lean` |
| `thm:kplanes` | descent inequality: one reassign-then-refit round never increases the cost (abstract alternating minimization) | `Clustering.lean` |
| `thm:kplanes` | termination: the antitone cost sequence has finitely many attainable values, so Lloyd iteration stabilizes | `Clustering.lean` |
| Welsh–Powell | greedy `Δ+1` coloring of a conflict graph, any insertion order (from scratch — Mathlib has no such bound) | `Coloring.lean` |
| `thm:potato` | the sandwich `μ(greedy trim) ≤ convex skull ≤ μ(P)`: the trim is a feasible convex blank, the skull dominates all of them | `Common.lean` |
| NFP separation | translated part meets a fixed part iff `t ∈ A−B` (the no-fit polygon); placing outside it ⇒ disjoint — the nester's zero-overlap guarantee | `Packing.lean` |
| `lem:plane` | the least-squares Gram form is positive definite iff the picks span (non-collinear) — existence/uniqueness of the dip plane | `Fitting.lean` |
| `thm:lambert` | the Schmidt/Lambert radial map `r=√2 sin(θ/2)` satisfies `r·r' = ½ sinθ` — equal-area (undistorted pole density) | `Projection.lean` |
| `thm:lpt` | scheduling optimum lower bounds, the `(2−1/m)` list-scheduling makespan bound, and the tight `4/3−1/3m` arithmetic core | `Machines.lean` |
| `thm:cpd` | EM / Soft-ICP / CPD monotonicity (abstract minorize-maximize: the objective never decreases) | `TierThree.lean` |
| `thm:poisson` | the least-squares Euler–Lagrange normal equation `T†(Tx−V)=0 ⇒` minimizer (with `T=∇` this is `Δχ=∇·V`) | `TierThree.lean` |
| `thm:cra` | the safe-theorem feasible region `K ∩ A⁻¹{g}` is convex, and the Gale/Farkas duality converse (infeasible load ⇒ a separating collapse mechanism, via Hahn–Banach) | `TierThree.lean` |
| `thm:settle` | a variational-inequality stationary point of a convex energy is a global constrained minimum (rest = constrained energy min, sufficiency) | `TierThree.lean` |

Tier-3 (analysis/duality/PDE) is handled by `TierThree.lean` under a strict
policy: prove the sound abstract core, never axiomatize an equivalence to a
free predicate (which would be unsound). The remaining classical ingredients
(Gale/Farkas duality, KKT, Stolt, Varadhan) are a documented queue there,
each to be added as a cited axiom only with its exact, sound hypotheses.
| `thm:kintsugi` | world-pose composition `T_world = T_unnorm·T_net·T_norm`, faithful-action uniqueness, and `g`-conjugation equivariance under a global pre-transform | `Registration.lean` |
| `thm:qem` | per-plane quadric `= (⟪n,v⟫+d)²` = squared point-plane distance; total QEM convex; normal equations `∇=0 ⇒` global minimum | `Registration.lean` |

`FrahanProofs/Roadmap.lean` holds the full tier map for the remaining
~24 results; new exact statements land there as `proof_wanted` before
their proofs.
