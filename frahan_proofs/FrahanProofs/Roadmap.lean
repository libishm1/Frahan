Frahan StonePack — Lean formalization roadmap.

This file is the build order for mechanizing ALL named results of
`spec/frahan_algorithm_derivations.tex` (~33 theorems across §1–§27),
following `spec/PLAN_lean_formalization.md`. Statements appear here as
`proof_wanted` (exact statement, proof pending) or as structured TODO
comments when the statement itself still needs supporting definitions.
Nothing in this repository uses `sorry`: a result is either proved or
explicitly marked wanted here.

Status key: [P] proved (file) · [W] proof_wanted below ·
[D] needs definitions first · [A] Tier 3, will import a named classical
result as an axiom with citation when stated.

Tier 1 — combinatorial / induction / order
  [P] lem:sh        clip = intersection; subset + measure monotone (Common)
  [P] thm:trim      chain identity, subset, measure, convexity (Common)
  [P] thm:kahn      source-existence (Common) + linear extension (Scheduling)
  [D] thm:kahn      loop-correctness of the literal emit loop; stuck ⇒ cycle
  [P] thm:kplanes   descent inequality + finite termination (Clustering)
  [P] mode-merge    greedy mode-merge keeps pairwise-separated joint-set poles
                    (Clustering, mergeKeep_separated) — the clusterer merge step;
                    CODE-VERIFIED (0/19274 pole pairs within MergeDeg; code_ws
                    outputs/2026-07-24/clustering_verification)
  [P] (WelshPowell) greedy Δ+1 coloring, any insertion order (Coloring) —
                    built from scratch; Mathlib has no such bound
  [D] thm:imaiiri   BFS fewest-edges path = min-# approximation
  [D] thm:guillodp  Bellman recursion optimal over guillotine tilings
  [D] thm:hm        Hertel–Mehlhorn ≤ 4·OPT convex partition
  [P] thm:lpt       OPT lower bounds + (2−1/m) list-schedule bound + tight
                    4/3−1/3m arithmetic core (Machines); [W] execution-trace
                    realization + full Graham 4/3 (proof_wanted)
  [D] (FFD)         first-fit-decreasing 11/9·OPT + 6/9
  [P] thm:potato    greedy trim ≤ convex skull ≤ area(P) (Common) —
                    Chang–Yap exactness/complexity stays prose
  [P] nfp-sep       no-fit-polygon placement ⇒ disjoint parts (Packing) —
                    overlap ⟺ t ∈ A−B, and t ∉ A−B ⇒ disjoint. Matches the
                    code-verified nester (0 overlap / 34832 pairs; code_ws
                    outputs/2026-07-24/nester_verification). Gap CLOSED: proof
                    and code now agree.

Tier 2 — linear algebra / spectral / Fourier
  [P] prop:power    power cell convex (Power)
  [P] lem:clip3d    subsumed: the development is dimension-generic (Common)
  [P] lem:plane     non-collinear ⇒ Gram form PosDef ⇔ picks span (Fitting);

                    normal (Spectral, Rayleigh lower-bound); [W] eigenvalue
                    identification (spectral theorem); OBB-in-eigenbasis prose
  [P] thm:qem       vᵀKₚv = squared plane dist; QEM convex; ∇=0 ⇒ global
                    min (Registration) — matrix-block Q̄v̄=−b stays basis form
  [P] thm:phasecorr DFT shift theorem + normalized cross-power = unit phase
                    (Fourier); [W] inverse-DFT of phase = shifted delta/peak
  [P] thm:lambert   r = √2 sin(θ/2): r·r' = ½ sinθ area-element identity
                    (Projection)
  [D] §5 planarity  best-fit plane = least eigvec; Chebyshev deviation

Tier 3 — analysis / duality / PDE (state exactly; axiomatize the named
classical ingredient with a citation; discharge as Mathlib grows)
  [P] thm:cpd          EM/MM monotonicity mm_monotone (TierThree)
  [P] thm:poisson      least-squares E–L normal equation poisson_normal_eq_min

  [P] thm:cra          convex-feasibility admissibleSet_convex + Gale/Farkas
                       duality converse cra_farkas (TierThree, via Hahn–Banach)
  [P] thm:blocktheory  Removable def + not_removable half (TierThree, Shi)
  [P] thm:settle       convex-optimality core settle_convex_optimality +
                       [A] KKT necessity settle_kkt (cited axiom, LICQ) — TierThree
  [P] thm:stolt        amplitude Jacobian ∂ω/∂k_z = c·k_z/√ (TierThree,
                       stolt_dispersion_jacobian); full Fourier remap = prose
  [A] thm:heat         Varadhan limit recovers geodesic distance (last queued)
  NOTE: Tier-3 policy — prove the sound abstract core, never axiomatize an
  equivalence to a free predicate (unsound). See TierThree.lean.

                    g-conjugation equivariance (Registration)

-- No `proof_wanted` is currently open: every remaining [D] item needs
-- its supporting definitions (graphs-with-paths, tilings, machine
-- schedules, …) stated first, and every [A] item awaits its Tier-3
-- axiomatization pass. New exact statements land here before proofs.
